# RAG_financetracking

## To dos:
  * Tried RAG and LLM finetuning, for data analysis.
  * Could make it beter by using SLM instead of json.
  * Creating a simple app that automates finding the records could improve user expereince.
  * QwenVL-8b didnt perform well on images and took a large amount of time so, had to resort to OCR.
  * deppseek-r1:8b works great and fast as well with chromaDB RAG with 1024 size embedding, the texts are small so could use a smaller embedding model.
  * Creating a easier way to finetune LLM, a script would allow things to be more personalized for now.
  * Currently hardcoded for bank statement image from mobile banking, finetuning qwenVL for OCR and data extarction would make it more versatile.
