Introduction
This document provides an overview of key financial concepts and metrics that are essential for understanding business performance and financial health.

Revenue and Income
Revenue represents the total income generated from normal business operations. It is the top line of the income statement and includes all sales of goods and services before any costs or expenses are deducted.

Key Revenue Metrics:
- Gross Revenue: Total revenue before deductions
- Net Revenue: Revenue after returns, discounts, and allowances
- Revenue Growth Rate: Percentage increase in revenue over time

Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are the costs associated with running the business. These include:

1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): Direct costs of producing goods or services
2. Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A): Overhead costs
3. Research and Development (R&D): Innovation and product development costs
4. Depreciation and Amortization: Non-cash expenses for asset value reduction

Profitability Metrics
Several metrics help assess a company's profitability:

Gross Profit Margin: (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
- Indicates how efficiently a company produces goods
- Higher margins suggest better pricing power or cost control

Operating Profit Margin: Operating Income / Revenue
- Shows profitability after operating expenses
- Excludes interest and taxes

Net Profit Margin: Net Income / Revenue
- The bottom line profitability metric
- Accounts for all expenses, including interest and taxes

Cash Flow Analysis
Cash flow is the movement of money in and out of the business:

Operating Cash Flow: Cash generated from core business operations
- Positive operating cash flow indicates a healthy business
- Should be consistently positive for sustainable operations

Free Cash Flow: Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
- Available cash for expansion, dividends, or debt reduction
- Critical metric for assessing financial flexibility

Balance Sheet Components
The balance sheet shows a company's financial position at a point in time:

Assets:
- Current Assets: Cash, accounts receivable, inventory
- Fixed Assets: Property, plant, equipment
- Intangible Assets: Patents, trademarks, goodwill

Liabilities:

Investment Analysis
When analyzing investment opportunities, consider:

Return on Investment (ROI): (Gain - Cost) / Cost
